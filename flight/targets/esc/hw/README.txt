This is an STM32F1 based ESC I made several years ago that
I really enjoyed playing with. It isnâ€™t really cost effective
to manufacture compared to the plethora of ESCs out there
but has some nice features that people might find useful.

 - Reprogrammable and configurable from FC via soft-usart
   via PWM line
 - Per ESC current monitoring which enables more sophisticated
   control schemes
 - Plays A-team theme song at power up
 - Matlab analysis tools for performance optimization
 - Closed loop or open loop control
 - CAN interface (not implemented yet) or with this
   unpopulated works via PWM

I will clean up the code and update the README.txt with a link
once done. Hopefully this will be fun for someone else.

Credit also goes to MattL on OP forums for helping shrink the
